# Integers
## Definition
- An integer is a number that is a whole number positive and negative integers are rational
- e.g. integers can be described as a bank account debt being in debt(negative) or having money in it(positive)

## Properties
- communatative property: when a + b = c    b + a = c when (a)(b) = c (b)(a) = c
- associative property: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) ((a)( b))(c ) = (a)((b)( c))
- identity property: when a equals any given integer (a)(0)=0 (a)(1)=a a/1=a a-0=a
- opposite integers when a equals any given integer a is the opposite of -a 
- inverse properties: a + (-a) = 0 (a)(1/a)=1
## Operations
### Adding and subtracting
- adding can be understood as putting two or more numbers together and combining theme.g. 1+2=3
- subtraction is the opposite of addition taking something away from something else
### Multiplying and subtracting
- multiplying and dividing can be understood as repeated addition and subtraction respectively
- exponents and roots are repeated multiplication and division
### Solving equations with integers
- an equation are operations connected by an equal sign
- an expression are operations with no signs connecting them
##### Order of operations
- first brackets then exponents then multiplying and dividing then adding and subtracting
- go from right to left normally
- division and multiplying are to be done from left to right they are the same priority
- same as addition and subtraction
